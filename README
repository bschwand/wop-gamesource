    changes to get WOP to build and run on mac osx 10.10 with SDL2.
    the release binaries seem to use a deprecated osx API and thus would not run
    (crash on startup).
    so, I updated to use SDL2.
    Also updated to use libraries installed from the macports project
    to build, first install macports, then the following libs with 
    sudo port install <portname>

    jpeg9
    SDL2
    libtheora
    vorbis
    vorbisfile
    ogg
    pkgconfig

    TODO: 
    - find why vm compiler crashes (at least for osx x86_64)
      workaround: disable compiler, just use the interpreter
    - why conflict with included jpeg lib version
      workaround: disabled using internal jpeg
    - find why a sound buffer is periodically NULL, causing game crash
      workaround: check valid sound buffer, skip if not
