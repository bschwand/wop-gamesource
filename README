    changes to get WOP to build and run on mac osx 10.10 with SDL2.
    the released binaries seem to use a deprecated osx API and thus would not run
    (crash on startup).
    so, I updated to use SDL2.
    Also updated to use libraries installed from the macports project
    to build, first install macports, then the following libs with 
    sudo port install <portname>

    jpeg9
    SDL2
    libtheora
    vorbis
    vorbisfile
    ogg
    pkgconfig

    generated binaries are

    build/release-darwin-x86_64/wopded.x86_64
    build/release-darwin-x86_64/wop.x86_64
    build/release-darwin-x86_64/renderer_opengl1_x86_64.dylib

    install version 1.5 from here
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/worldofpadman/files/wop-1.5.1-full.dmg/download
    then overlay files from here to update to version 1.6
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/worldofpadman/files/wop-1.5.x-to-1.6-patch-unified.zip/download
    then move generated binaries to
     /Applications/World_of_Padman/wop.app/Contents/MacOS/
     rename wop.x86_64 to wop-engine.ub
     rename wopded.x86_64 to wopded.ub

    TODO: 
    - find why vm compiler crashes (at least for osx x86_64)
      workaround: disable compiler in Makefile, just use the interpreter
    - why conflict with included jpeg lib version
      workaround: disabled using internal jpeg
    - find why a sound buffer is periodically NULL, causing game crash
      workaround: check valid sound buffer, skip if not
